# Conways_game_of_life
This is a simple program of Conway's game of life. Conway's game of life is a easy to understand simulation of
cells. These cells live on a 2D grid and can either be alive (true) or dead (false). The flow of time is discretized 
into steps. If a cell dies or gets born in the next time steps, is decided by the state of the neighbouring cells and
follows three simple rules:
1. A dead cell with exactly three living neighbours begins to live.
2. A living cell with exactly two or three living neighbors continues living.
3. All other cells die due to overpopulation or isolation.
